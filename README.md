# CS340 Client/Server Development

1.  How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable, readable and adaptable programs comes down to concise execution of the programs purpose through efficient syntax, structured and commented sections of code and using logic that can be easily understood and repurposed by yourself or others in the future.  This prevents the need to  completely redesign and rewrite code, but it allows us to reuse code over and over again, effectively reaching our development goals in an efficient manner.

2.  How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach a problem by understanding the end goal, the requirements of the task, the information at hand and connecting the dots.  Iterating through the development process one section at a time, ensured that I successfully accomplished something over a set period of time, rather than attempting to complete the entire program over the entire course of the development period.

3.  What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists take real world problems and provide technological solutions that help us accomplish them through either automation, increased efficiency or for the first time ever due to the processing power and speed of computers.  This alleviates us from spending time doing mundane and repetitive tasks, when we can just write programs to do them for us or it can help us solve complex problems that would required too much time for a single person or a team of persons to completed.
